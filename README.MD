## Task 1. Square Every Digit

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

## Task 2. Split Strings

Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

Examples:

``` 
* 'abc' =>  ['ab', 'c_']
* 'abcdef' => ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']
```


## Task 3. Adding Big Numbers

Source: https://www.codewars.com/kata/525f4206b73515bffb000b21/train/java

We need to sum big numbers, and we require your help.

Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers. The input numbers are strings and the function must return a string.

Example:
``` 
add("123", "321"); -> "444"
add("11", "99");   -> "110"
```

Notes:
- The input numbers are big.
- The input is a string of only digits.
- The numbers are positives.

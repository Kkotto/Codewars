### Task 1
Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).

Examples
```
"the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"
"The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"
```

### Task 2
Complete the solution so that it returns true if the first argument(string) passed in ends with the 2nd argument (also a string).

Examples:
```
solution('abc', 'bc') // returns true
solution('abc', 'd') // returns false
```
